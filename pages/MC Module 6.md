- 5G
	- Low battery consumption
	- Better coverage at the edge of the cells
	- High data rate at the edge of the cells
	- Better security
	- Energy efficient and spectral efficient.
- MIMO
	- MIMO stands for multiple input and output
	- It increases that capacity of the channel in radio link by using multiple sending and receiving antennas
	- One advantage is that more data can be added to the wireless network.
	- The energy efficiency & spectral efficiency increases. Reliability also increases.
- Features of 5G
	- Advanced billing interface
	- High quality service
	- Provides virtual private networks.
	- enhanced and available connection
- LiFi
	- Uses LED lights to transmit data wirelessly
	- Has a much broader transmission spectrum
	- Uses visible area of the spectrum for transmission while WiFi uses radio waves.
	- Fixed bandwidth is a disadvantage of WiFi; LiFi can solve this issue.
	- Data is transferred by varying the intensity of the light. These variations cannot be picked up by the human eye.
	- It is a much cheaper and faster alternative to WiFi.
	- Architecture
		- A high brightness white light is used as source
		- A silicon photodiode with good response to visible light can be used as the receiver.
	- Components
		- Bulb
		- RF power amplifier
		- PCB
		- Enclosure
	- PCB controls the inputs and outputs of the lamp
	- RF signals are created by the power amplifier and concentrated on the bulb.
	- The center of the bulb vaporizes and enters plasma state and start to emit light.
	- LiFi is 80% more efficient because no interference is there unlike radio waves.
