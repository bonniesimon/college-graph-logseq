- Week 2
	- 6LoWPAN
		- Low power Wireless Personal Area Network over IPv6
		- Allows for the smallest devices with limited processing ability to transmit information wirelessly using internet protocol.
		- Allows low power devices to connect to the internet.
	- RFID
		- Radio Frequency Identification
		- Data digitally encoded in RFID tags, which can be read by a reader.
		- Somewhat similar to bar codes.
		- Compared to barcodes, data in RFID tag can be read without line of sight
		- Working principle
			- RFID uses radio waves to perform AIDC functions
			- AIDC is Automation Identification and Data Capture technology.
			- RFID derived from AIDC.
			- AIDC uses wired communication
		- Applications
			- Inventory management
			- Asset tracking
			- personnel tracking
			- ID badging
	- ## MQTT
		- Message Queue Telemetry Transport
		- lightweight messaging protocol
		- publish subscriber based
		- used in conjunction with TCP/IP protocol
		- A topic to which a client is subscribed is updated in the form of messages by the message broker.
		- MQTT components
			- Publishers
			- Subscribers
			- Brokers
				- connect subscribers and publishers
		- Architecture
			- MQTT uses publisher-subscriber architecture. HTTP uses request-response architecture.
			- Publisher subscriber is event driven
		- Applications
			- FB messenger uses MQTT for online chat
			- Amazon Web services uses MQTT with amazon IoT
	- ## CoAP
		- Constrained Application Protocol
		- Web transfer protocol for constrained nodes and networks.
		- Designed for M2M applications.
		- Based on Request Response model
		- It is a session layer protocol
