## Routing
	- Main function of network layer is routing packets from source machine to the destination machine.
	- The algorithms that choose the routes and the data structures that they use are a major area of network layer design.
	- Routing Algorithm is that part of the network layer responsible for deciding which output line an incoming packet should be transmitted on.
	- Routing Vs Forwarding
		- Router has two process in it : one is forwarding and the other routing.
		- Forwarding : to select an output port based on destination address and routing table
		- Routing : process by which routing table is built. It is responsible for filling and updating routing tables. That is where routing algorithm comes into play.
	- Forwarding Table
		- Used for forwarding a packet.
		- So must contain enough information to accomplish that function
		- A row in forwarding table contains : mapping from network number to an outgoing interface and some mac information, such as Ethernet address of the next hop.
	- Routing Table
		- Built by the routing algorithm as a precursor to building the forwarding table.
		- Generally contains mappings from network numbers to next hops
	- Network as a Graph
		- The basic problem of routing is to find the lowest cost path between any two nodes. Where the cost of a path is the sum of the costs of all the edges that make up the path.
		- For a simple network, we can calculate all the shortest paths and load them into a storage on each node.
		- Disadvantages:
			- Does not account for node failures
			- Does not account for addition of new nodes.
			- Edges costs cannot change, not flexible.
