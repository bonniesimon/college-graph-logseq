## Executive Summary
	- DP-3T is a system for secure and privacy-preserving proximity tracking at large scale.
	- DP-3T provides a technological foundation to help slow the spread of SARS-CoV 2.
	- It achieve this by simply accelerating the process of notifying people who might have been exposed to the virus so that they can take appropriate measures to break its transmission chain.
	- Implementing such a system so that privacy and security are respected is of importance today.
## Context and Need
	- TTIQ - Testing, contact Tracing, Isolation and Quarantine
	- The cornerstone of TTIQ technique is contact tracing.
	- It identifies people who have had contact with the patient and possibly have covid.
	- 2-3 days before the onset of symptoms, that is the period where half of the overall transmission occurs
	- Manual tracing relies on Interviews conducted by trained personnel.
		- Time consuming
		- Require workers
		- Interview response based on memory of the affected person, would not be reliable.
## Purpose
	- Alerts you when you've come near contact of a affected person.
	- Doesn't reveal the identity of the contacted person.
## DP3T
	- Three different protocols are specified to support different tradeoff's between exposure detection and tracing.
	- Developers can choose the tradeoff they want while using a common framework.
	- Working
		- Each phone locally generates a frequently changing ephemeral identifier (EphIDs)
		- These EphIDs are then broadcasted via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) ?beacons.
			- BLE is a low power wireless communication technology that can be used over a short distance to enable smart devices to communicate.
			- BLE is a relatively new technology with a focus on low energy.
		- Other phones observe these beacons and store them with a time indication and measurements to estimate exposure.
		- When a patient is diagnosed with Covid-19, they will be authorized by health authorities to publish a protocol specific representation of their EphIDs
		- When authorized, users can instruct their phones to upload a representation of the EphIDs to the backend.
		- The backend stores the uploaded representations. To protect the patients from network observers, all phones generate dummy traffic to provide plausible deniability of real uploads.
		- Other phones periodically query the backend for information and reconstruct the corresponding EphIDs of the positive users locally.
		- If the phone has recorded the beacon corresponding to any reported EphIDs, then the phone's user might have been exposed to the virus.
		- The phone uses exposure measurements of the matched beacons to estimate the exposure of the phone's owner.
	- Architecture
		- The proximity tracing process is supported by a backend server.
		- The backend server distributes anonymous exposure information to the app running on each phone.
		- Backend server trusted to not add information nor remove information.
		- Backend solely acts as a communication platform and doesn't process any information.
		- Purpose of this is so that even if the server is compromised or seized, their privacy remain intact.
	- The three protocols are :
		- Low-cost decentralized proximity tracing
		- Unlinkable decentralized proximity tracing
		- Hybrid decentralized proximity tracing
## Low-cost decentralized proximity tracing
	- This is a low cost protocol with good privacy measures but very small bandwidth requirements.
	- Setup
		- Initial seed generation.
		- Let t be the current day in UTC days.
		- Smartphones generate a random initial daily seed SK <sub>t</sub> for the current day t.
	- Creating ephemeral IDs
		- Each day, the smartphones rotate their secret day seed SK <sub>t</sub> by computing SK <sub>t</sub> = H(SK <sub>t - 1</sub>)
			- where H is a cryptographic hash function.
		- Smartphone will use the seed SK <sub>t</sub> during day t to generate EphIDs.
		- To avoid location tracking via broadcast identifiers, devices should frequently change the ephemeral identifier EphID that they broadcast to other devices.
		- The duration for which a device broadcasts the same EphID is referred as epoch.
		- Length of an epoch (in minutes) can be changed using L
		- At the beginning of each day t, smartphones locally generate a list of n = (24*60) / L new EphIDs to broadcast during day t.
		- Give the day seed SK <sub>t</sub>, each device computes
			- EphID​ <sub>1</sub>​ || ... || EphID​ <sub>n</sub>​ = PRG( PRF(SK <sub>t</sub>, “broadcast key”) ),
				- where PRF : pseudo random function
				- broadcast key is a fixed public string
				- PRG is the pseudo random generator producing n*16 bytes.
		- Smartphones randomly pick up the EphIDs generated during the day. Each EphID is broadcasted for L minutes.
	- Local storage of observed EphIDs and seeds SK <sub>t</sub>
		- For each received beacon the phone stores
			- The received ephemeral Bluetooth identifier EphID
			- The exposure measurement
			- The day on which this beacon was received.
		- Being in contact with 100 people per epoch(15 min) over a course of 14day would require 6.1mb
		- Each phone stores the EphIDs it generated during the past 14 days.
	- Decentralized Proximity tracing
		- Once authorized, the patient can instruct their phone to send to the backend the seed SK <sub>t</sub> and the day t corresponding to the first day in which the user was considered contagious.
		- After uploading their seed, it then picks a completely random seed and commences broadcasting of EphIDs derived from this new seed. This ensures uploading of their past seed, users do not become trackable.
		- The backend collects the pairs (SK <sub>t</sub>, t) of Covid-19 positive users.
		- Phones periodically download these pairs.
		- Each smartphone users this pair to reconstruct the list of EphIDs of the diagnosed person for each day t' and checks
			- if it has observed any beacon with on of these EphIDs on day t'.
			- that such observations occurred before the corresponding seed SK <sub>t</sub> was published.
		- For each matching recorded beacon, the beacon's receive time and exposure measurement are taken into account for exposure risk computation.
## Unlinkable decentralized proximity tracing
	- It is a variant of the low cost design
	- It offers better privacy properties at the cost of increased bandwidth.
