# Basic Concepts in Computer Graphics
	- Computer graphics is the pictorial representation or manipulation of data by a computer.
	- ## Non interactive or passive computer graphics
		- The picture is produced by the computer and the user has no control on it.
		- User cannot make any changes in the image
		- Eg: screensavers
	- ## Interactive or active computer graphics
		- User can make changes to the produced image.
		- Users have some control over the picture.
		- Commands can be sent using input devices
		- Eg: games
	- Every image or picture is a graph
		- different mathematical techniques are applied to manipulate some change in its properties like shape, size, motion, etc.
	- Each picture consists of points called pixels (picture element)
	- Pixel
		- Full form of pixel is Picture Element
		- Smallest element of an image on a computer display
		- It is represented as a dot or a square on the screen
		- Pixel can have at most one color at a time
			- Color of a pixel is determined by the number of bytes used to represent it
		- Screen is made up of matrix of pixels
			- thousands and millions of pixels
		- Each pixel has a value or a unique logical address
	- Resolution
		- number of pixels contained on a display monitor
		- measures the number of pixels in a digital image or display
		- It is defined a `width by height` or W x H,
			- W : number of horizontal pixels
			- H : Number of vertical pixels
	- Aspect Ratio
		- Ratio between width of an image and height of an image
		- Two numbers separated by a colon, eg: 16:9
# Input Devices
	- Input device is any peripheral used to provide
		- data and control signals
		- to an information processing system
	- List of input devices are
		- Mouse
		- Keyboard
		- Trackball
		- Space ball
		- Joystick
		- Digitizer
		- Dials
		- Button boxes
	- ?? Explaining each input devices
# Applications of CG
	- used in areas such as
		- science, engineering
		- medicine
		- business
		- industry, government
		- art, entertainment
		- advertising
		- education & training
	- ?? Different fields of application
# Video Display Devices
	- Cathode Ray Tube
		- A beam of electro (cathode rays) is emitted using an electron gun
			- they pass through a focussing and deflection system
			- which directs the beam toward specified positions
			- on a phosphor coated screen
		- The phosphor then emits a small spot of light at every position contacted by the electron beam
			- The light fades very rapidly
			- to maintain the spot of light, we repeatedly emit electrons to the same spot
			- This type of display is called Refresh CRT
