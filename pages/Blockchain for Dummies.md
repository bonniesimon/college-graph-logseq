- Blockchain as the name suggests is a chain of blocks. Each block contains data.
- Each block is tied to some other blocks. Each block is reliant on the block before it.
- In case of bitcoin, the data that the block encapsulates is the series of bitcoin transactions that have taken place in a certain timeframe.
- So basically blockchain is a immutable shared ledger.
- All blocks constitute Bitcoin's blockchain and have witnessed all its transactions till its creation.
- History
	- Blockchain was invented as a response to the inefficiencies of the centralized banking system.
	- It was launched in 2009 right after the 07/08 market crash and this might not be a coincident.
- Where is blockchain located?
	- Blockchains are a network of computers located all over the world.
	- Computers contributing to a given blockchain possesses the data or transactions that have ever been written on the blockchain.
	- In simple terms (or may be it's a complex term idk), blockchains are decentralized.
	- More the number of computers, stronger the blockchain.
- There are public as well as private blockchains.
	- In public, an open source software is used by everyone participating in the network. Anyone can join the network.
	- In private, the same principles as the public ones except the software is proprietary and hosted on private servers instead. Eg: Wallmart is creating blockchains to track supply-chain logistics.
- What does blockchains solve?
	- Blockchains provides a method of recording and transferring data in a transparent, trusted and provable way.
	- It allows companies and individuals to engage in a transfer system that is fully transparent, democratic and secure.
	- Most importantly, it allows trust-less storage and transactions, removing the need for intermediates.
		- Amazon monetizes trust as the intermediary between sellers and customers.
		- Uber monetizes trust as the intermediary between drivers and customers.
	- Having a central point of data collection poses a security risk, your information no longer belongs to you, a company now owns it. What they do with it is prerogative.
	- The adoption of blockchain will remove the need for third parties and will allow _trust-less_ _peer-to-peer_ transactions.
	- Blockchain is currently disrupting or it will disrupt any industry that involves data and transactions.
- Miners
	- Miners are an important part of the bitcoin.
	- Their definition and specifications depend blockchain involved.
	- Miners are individuals or companies that run special software that is required to build onto the blockchain.
	- They make the blockchain operational. Without them there would be no computers running the network and no way to conduct transactions with it.
	- Rewards are given to miners for who find the next block in the public, open source chain. Rewards are distributed in bitcoin's blockchain.
