- *Spread Spectrum*
  - (Refer John Shiller MC text)
  - spread spectrum is the technique of spreading the band-width need to transmit data
  - Advantages
    - Resistance to narrowband interference
    - power level of the spread signal much lower without losing data
  - Can also be used to reduce narrowband interference for several channels, not just single channel
  - Between each frequency band, a guard space is needed to avoid adjacent channel interference
  - To sperate different channels, CDM is used instead of FDM.
  - Spreading of signal is done using a special code
  - this code is required at the receivers end to recover the signal at that channel
  - each channel has a different code used to spread it
  - without the code the signal appears to be background noise.
  - Disadvantages
    - Increased complexity at the receivers end to recover the signal
    - large frequency band needed due to spreading the signal
  - SS can be achieved in different ways:
    - *Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum*
      - DSSS systems take user bit stream and perform an XOR with a chipping sequence
      - Chipping sequence is a pseudo random generated number.
      - spreading factor s = tb / tc

      - Wireless LAN's use barker code. When implemented with DSSS, barker codes exhibit good robustness against interference and insensitivity to multi-path propagation
