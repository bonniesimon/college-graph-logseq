  collapsed:: true
	- currMax stores the maximum value till now. `currMax = max(a[i], a[i] * currMax, a[i]*currMin)`
	- we do `a[i]*currMin` because if a[i] is a negative number, then multiplying it with the smallest number i.e currMin (negative number with max magnitude) then we'll get the largest product.
	- [2, 3, -2, 4, -1]
		- on reaching 4, currMax = 4 and currMin = -48
		- so when taking -1, currMax = a[i] * currMin
			- i.e (-1)*currMin
