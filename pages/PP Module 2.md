- Data types
	- it is a classification that specifies what type of value a variable has
		- and what type of mathematical relational or logical operations can be applied on it without causing error
	- Two purpose
		- To provide implicit context for many operations
		- Types limit the set of operations that may be performed
			- eg: adding a character and array
- Type system
	- consists of a mechanism to define types
		- and to associate language constructs with them
	- a set of rules for type equivalence, type compatibility, type inference
		- Type equivalence: To check whether types of two values are equal
		- Type compatibility: To check whether a value of the type can be used in the given context
		- Type Inference: rules to define the type of an expression based on its constituent parts or the surrounding context
	- Subroutines also have types in some languages
		- when they are passed as argument, returned by functions and stored in variables.
- Type checking
  collapsed:: true
	- process of ensuring that the program obeys the languages type compatibility rules
	- A violation of the rules : type clash
	- Strongly Typed
		- a language that prohibits any operation to any object that is not intended to support that operation
		- Variables are necessarily bound to a particular datatype
		- Eg: ada, cpp
	- Weakly Typed
		- Variables are not of a specific data type
		- Variables have datatypes, but are not bound to a specific data type
		- eg: php, javascript
	- Statically Typed
		- A language is said to be statically typed if it is strongly typed and type checking happens at compile time
		- variables are declared before they are used
		- eg: java, c, cpp
	- Dynamic Typing
		- Type checking happens at runtime
		- most scripting languages
		- eg: lisp, smalltalk
	- Polymorphism
		- allows a single body of code to work with objects of multiple types
- Types
	- types can be categorized in 3 ways
		- Denotational
		- Constructive
		- Abstraction based
- Classification of Types
	- ??
- Type Checking
	- In a statically typed language, every definition of an object must specify the object's type
	- Type equivalence, type compatibility, type inference
	- Type checking can be static or dynamic
	- Type Equivalence
		- Two types
			- Name Equivalence
				- Two types are equal if and only if they have the same name
			- Structural Equivalence
				- Two types are equal if and only if they have the same structure
					- same name and same type definitions in the correct order
			- Ada follows name equivalence while ML follows structural equivalence
	- Type compatibility
		- a values type must be compatible with that of the context it appears in
		- 3 types
			- Assignment compatibility
			- Expression compatibility
			- Parameter compatibility
	- Type inference
		-
