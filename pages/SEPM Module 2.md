- *Capability Maturity Model (CMM)*
- *Requirements Engineering*
  - Requirements
    - descriptions of what the systems should do
    - services that it provides and the constraints on its operation
    - reflect the needs of the customers
  - The process of finding out, analysing, documenting and checking the services and constraints of a system is called requirements engineering.
  - Types of Requirements
    - User requirements
      - high level abstract requirements
      - statements in natural language
      - services the system is expected to provide to system users
      - and constraints under which it must operate
    - System requirements
      - detailed description of what the systems should do
      - system software's functions, services and operational constraints
    - Functional requirements
      - statements of service the system should provide
      - how the system should react to particular inputs
      - how the system should behave in particular situations
    - Non Functional requirements
      - constraints on the services and functions offered by the system. eg : time constraints, constraints on the development process and constraints imposed on standards.
      - apply to the system as a whole rather than individual system services
  - Requirements engineering activities result in
    - the specification of the software's operational characteristics (function, data and behaviour),
    - indicate software's interface with other system elements and,
    - establish constraints that the software must meet.

- *Requirement Analysis*
  - It is a SE task that bridges the gap between system level requirements engineering and software design.
  - Requirements analysis allows the software engineer to
    - refine the software allocation and,
    - refine the build models of the data,
    - refine the functional, and behavioural domains that will be treated by the software.
  - Requirements analysis allow the software engineer to represent information, function and behaviour in a way that it can be easily translated into data, architectural, interface and component level designs.
