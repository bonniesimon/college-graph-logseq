- *Capability Maturity Model (CMM)*
- ISO 9000
	- source : module 2 ktuassist notes
	- ISO is a consortium established to formulate, maintain and foster standardization.
	- ISO 9000 specifies set of guidelines for
		- maintaining a quality system.
		- repeatable and high quality product development
		- the production process
	- IS0 9001
		- applies to organizations that are involved in the design, development, production and servicing of goods
		- This is the standard applicable to software development.
	- ISO 9002
		- applies to organizations involved in the production of products but not involved in the design of those products
		- not applicable to software development
	- ISO 9003
		- applies to organizations involved only in the installation and testing of the products
	- Need for obtaining ISO 9000 certification
		- Confidence of the customers in the organization increases
		- ISO 9000 requires a well documented software development process. This contributes to the repeatable and higher quality of the developed software.
		- Makes the development process focussed, efficient and cost-effective.
		- Points out the weak points of the organization
		- Sets a basic framework for the development of an optimal process.
	- **ISO 9001**
		- Main requirements related to software industry
			- Management responsibility
			- Quality system
			- Process control
			- Design control
			- Document control
			- Testing and Inspection
			- Training
		- Features of ISO 9001
			- All documents related to the development of software product should be properly managed, authorized and controlled. This requires a software configuration management.
			- Important documents should be independently checked and reviewed for effectiveness and correctness.
			- Proper plans and schedules must be prepared
			- Progress against these plans should also be monitored.
			- Product should be tested against specification
	- Shortcomings of ISO 9000
		- Provides a software process model to be adhered to but does not guarantee the process to be high quality
		- Does not give any guideline for defining a appropriate process
		- ISO 9000 certificate can be used for corporate advertisements but not for product advertisements.
		- ISO 9000 does not automatically lead to a continuous process improvement
- *Requirements Engineering*
	- Requirements
		- descriptions of what the systems should do
		- services that it provides
		- reflect the needs of the customers
		- the constraints on its operation
	- The process of finding out, analysing, documenting and checking the services and constraints of a system is called requirements engineering.
	- Types of Requirements
		- source : studoob and ktuassist
		- User requirements
			- high level abstract requirements
			- statements in natural language
			- services the system is expected to provide to system users
			- and constraints under which it must operate
			- Written for clients
		- System requirements
			- detailed description of what the systems should do
			- system software's functions, services and operational constraints
			- Written as a contract between client and contractor
		- Software specification
			- A detailed software description
			- serves as a basis for design and development
			- Written for developers
		- Functional requirements
			- statements of service the system should provide
			- how the system should react to particular inputs
			- how the system should behave in particular situations
		- Non Functional requirements
			- constraints on the services and functions offered by the system. eg : time constraints, constraints on the development process and constraints imposed on standards.
			- apply to the system as a whole rather than individual system services
	- Requirements engineering activities result in
		- the specification of the software's operational characteristics (function, data and behaviour),
		- indicate software's interface with other system elements and,
		- establish constraints that the software must meet.

- Requirements Engineering Process
	- source : ktuassist note
	- Process used to discover, analyse and validate requirements
	- RE processes are
		- Feasibility Study
			- An estimate made of whether the users needs can be satisfied by the current software technologies
			- Whether the proposed project is feasible in a business view point
			- This study should be cheap and quick
		- Requirements elicitation and analysis
		- Requirements specification
		- Requirements validation
- *Requirement Analysis*
	- It is a SE task that bridges the gap between system level requirements engineering and software design.
	- Requirements analysis allows the software engineer to
		- refine the software allocation and,
		- refine the build models of the data,
		- refine the functional, and behavioural domains that will be treated by the software.
	- Requirements analysis allow the software engineer to represent information, function and behaviour in a way that it can be easily translated into data, architectural, interface and component level designs.
