- *Internet - the ubiquitous network*
  - Ubiquitous means everywhere
  - Only two ubiquitous networks are : telecommunication network and internet network.
    - Telecommunication uses SS#7 protocol
    - Internet uses TCP/IP protocol
  - Packet switched networks like internet can tolerate some delays while real time communication is better provided by telecommunication networks.
  - Network can be divided into three main segments :
    - Core
      - It is the backbone of the network
      - Innermost part of the network
      - Core looks at traffic from a bit stream point of view
      - Primary function : deliver traffic efficiently at the least cost.
      - Deals with transmission media and transfer points
    - Edge
      - Deals with the distribution of the traffic.
      - Edge looks at traffic from a service point of view.
      - Managed and owned by ISP's.
    - Access
      - Deals with the devices and how they will access the trafic.
      - Can be either wired or wireless. From a MC standpoint, it is wireless.
  - Internet is the preferred bearer network for content that can tolerate some delays. (Here bearer implies the thing that will carry the content, i.e internet)
  - Internet supports many protocols.
  - For ubiquitous access, web applications are preferred.
  - Web applications use HTTP and have a request/response model.
  - Difference between web application and convectional client/server paradigm
    - In convectional client server paradigm the client handles some business logic.
    - While in web application the clients only handle the rendering functions. This is handled by the web browsers. Thin clients that don't handle business logic.
- *Architecture for mobile computing *
  - Mobile computing uses a three tier architecture
    - ![image.png](C:/Other Stuff/logseq/college/assets/image_1621765464921_0.png)
    - The three tiers are :
      - Presentation or User Interface Tier
        - Deals with device handling and rendering
        - Include user system interface where user services reside. (user services are sessions, text input, dialog and display management)
      - Process Management or Application Tier
        - For application programs or process management
        - business logic and rules are executed here.
        - controls transactions and asynchronous queuing to ensure reliable connection.
        - Capable of accommodating hundreds of users.
      - Database Management or Data Tier
        - Used for database access and management
    - Three tier architecture
      id:: 60aa2f25-1ecf-4bba-abcd-69e75bc29f5f
      - is better suited for an effective client-server design
      - It provides increased _performance_, _flexibility_, _maintainability_, _reusability_ and _scalability_ .
      - hides complexity of distributed processing from the user
    - The above reasons have made the three tier architecture the choice for internet applications and net centric information systems.
- *Three Tier Architecture*
  - Designing a system for mobile computing means that the system will be used through any network, bearer, agent and device
  - Why it is necessary for mobile computing to have three tier architecture ?
    - ((60aa2f25-1ecf-4bba-abcd-69e75bc29f5f))
  - Why is it necessary for mobile computing to use internet?
    collapsed:: true
    - A system for mobile computing should be able to be accessed through any network, bearer, device and agent.
    - To have universal access, it is desirable for the server to be connected to a ubiquitous network like the internet.
