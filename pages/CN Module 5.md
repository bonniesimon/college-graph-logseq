# Internet Control Protocols
	- source
		- Tanenbaum
		- Behrouz
	- In addition to IP, which is used for data transfer, the internet has several companion control protocols that are used in the network layer.
	- ## ICMP - Internet Control Message Protocol
		- ICMP is an error reporting protocol for IP
		- When a network problem is encountered, ICMP does not correct it; it merely reports the problem.
			- When datagram delivery errors occur, ICMP is used to report these errors back to the source of the datagram.
		- ICMP is also used to test the internet.
		- It does not propagate information about the network changes to routers.
		- Different types of ICMP messages defined
			- Each ICMP message type is carried encapsulated in an IP packet.
			-
			  |       Message Type      |               Description               |
			  |:-----------------------:|:---------------------------------------:|
			  | Destination unreachable | Packet could not be delivered           |
			  | Time exceeded           | Time to live field hit 0                |
			  | Parameter problem       | Invalid header field                    |
			  | Source quench           | Choke packet                            |
			  | Redirect                | Teach a router about geography          |
			  | Echo request            | Ask a machine if it is alive            |
			  | Echo reply              | Yes, I am alive.                        |
			  | Timestamp request       | Same as Echo request but with timestamp |
			  | Timestamp reply         | Same as Echo reply but with timestamp   |

	- Address Mapping
		- The delivery of a packet to a host or a router requires two levels of addressing
			- Logical(IP address) & Physical (Ethernet or MAC) addressing.
		- Mapping Logical to Physical address (ARP)
		- Mapping Physical to Logical address (RARP)
		- How does IP address get mapped onto data link layer addresses such as Ethernet?
			- Answer in text pdf page no: 491 & also in ma'ams pdf.
			- We can use a configuration file that maps the IP addresses onto Ethernet addresses.
			- or we can use the following method.
			- Basically what happens is that say machine A wants to communicate with machine B.
			- A sends a broadcast packet onto the Ethernet asking who owns the IP address to which A has to send data
			- This broadcast arrives at every machine on the Ethernet and each one will check its IP address.
			- B will understand that it is B's IP address and respond.
			- This way A now knows that B is the one to which it needs to send data
			- The protocol used for asking this question and getting the reply is called ARP(Address Resolution Protocol)
			- The advantage of using ARP method over configuration files is that it's simple and less complex.
				- The system manager doesn't have to create a configuration file. Rather he simply needs to assign each machine an IP address and decide about subnet mask. ARP does the rest.
	- ## ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
		- For a sender to send the IP packet, the MAC address of the destination must be know.
		- ARP is used to find this.
		- If the destination is not know, then the sender broadcasts the ARP-discovery packet requesting the MAC address of the intended destination.
		- Since it is a broadcast, all the hosts in the network will get this ARP discovery packet. But only the intended host whose IP is associated will accept the packet. Everyone else will discard it.
		- The receiver will now send a unicast packet with its MAC address (ARP-reply) to the sender of the ARP-discovery packet.
		- After the original sender receives the ARP-reply, it updates the ARP cache and start sending unicast message to the destination.
		- Proxy ARP
			- When we need to send data to a host on another network
			- Proxy is used when we want the destination host to appear as if it's on the same network as the receiver but in reality it is present in another network.
			- Say host 1 and host 2 are in one network and host 3 and host 4 are in a different network.
			- Host 1 wants to send data to host 4.
			- We keep a proxy ARP in the first network which replies to the ARP-discovery packet sent by host 1 on behave of host 4.
			- Then after host one gets the ARP-reply, it'll sent data to host 4 which is present in another network.
	- ## RARP
	- Given an Ethernet address, how to get the IP address. We can use RARP
		- A machine can use physical address to get logical address using RARP
	- A RARP message is created and broadcast on the local network
	- The machine on the network that knows the logical address responds with RARP reply.
	- Disadvantage
		- Not forwarded by routers, hence RARP server is needed on each network.
		- Solution : Bootstrap protocol, BOOTP
			- uses UDP messages, which are forwarded over routers
	- ## BOOTP
		- The protocol allows diskless machines to discover their IP address and the address of the server host.
		- Events in BOOTP
			- The client broadcasts its MAC address asking for help in booting.
			- The BOOTP server responds with the data that specifies how the client should be configured
		- Disadvantage
			- It requires manual configuration of tables mapping IP addresses to Ethernet addresses.
		- To eliminate this problem we use DHCP
	- ## DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
		- Allows both manual IP address assignment and automatic assignment
		- Based on the idea of a special server that assign IP addresses to host asking for one.
		- ? working/events in DHCP
# Internet Multicasting
	- source: behrouz
	- The IP protocol can be involved in two types of communication:
		- unicasting
			- Communication between one sender and one receiver
			- One to one communication
		- multicasting
			- Communication between one sender and more than one receivers
			- One to many communication
			- Eg: video on demand, multiple users can be informed about a information
			- IP supports multicasting using class D addresses
			- 2 kinds of address are supported
				- permanent address
					- always there, no setup needed
				- temporary address
					- must be created before they are used.
					- Similar to how google meet works.
					- Ask its host to join a specific group
					- ask its host to leave the group
					- last process on a host leaves, group no longer present on the group
			- IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) is used for multicasting.
	- ## IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol)
		- source : behrouz
		- IGMP is a communication protocol used by hosts and adjacent routers for multicasting communication with IP networks and uses the resources efficiently to transmit messages/data packets.
		- Multicasting is implemented using special multicast routers that are able to route multicast packets
		- It is a protocol that manages Group membership
		- IGMP gives multicast routers information about membership status of hosts(routers) connected to the network.
			- A multicast router will receive thousands of multicast packets every day for different groups.
			- If a router has no knowledge about the membership status of the hosts, then it must broadcast all these packets.
			- This creates a lot of traffic and consumes bandwidth.
			- Solution: We maintain a list of the groups in the network for which there is at least one loyal member.
			- IGMP helps the multicast router create and update this list.
		- IGMP is used in IPv4 networks. Two kinds of packets are:
			- Query
			- Response
		- Multicast routing is done using Spanning Trees
	- An autonomous system (AS) is a group of networks and routers under the authority of a single administration.
		- A large corporation that manages it's own network has full control over it is an AS
		- A local ISP that provides services to local customers is an AS.
		- Routing algorithm within an AS is intra domain routing protocol : Interior Gateway Protocol (OSPF)
		- Routing algorithm between AS's is inter domain routing protocol : Exterior Gateway Protocol (BGP)
	- ## OSPF (Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
		- source: behrouz (pdf pg: 696)
		- OSPF is an implementation of the link state protocol
			- Link state protocol is used by every router to compute the shortest path from itself to all other nodes.
			- Many shortest paths are there, OSPF remembers this and during packet forwarding traffic is split across them.
			- Helps to balance load
				- ECMP (Equal Cost Multipath)
		- OSPF supports 3 kinds of connections and networks
			- Point to point lines between exactly 2 routers
			- Multiaccess networks with broadcasting (LAN)
			- Multiaccess networks without broadcasting (Switched WAN's)
		- To handle routing effectively, OFPF divides an AS into areas.
			- Each area is a collection of networks, hosts and routers all within an AS.
			- There is a special are in AS called _backbone_
			- All areas inside the AS should be connected to the backbone.
			- ? Learn graph representation of this
			- ? Learn message types
		-
	- ## BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
		- BGP is an implementation of path vector routing
		- Used between different ASes; Intradomain. So therefore we have to keep in mind different policies. Eg: A information from Pentagon must not be put through a route through Iraq.
		- We can divide AS into 3 categories
			- Stub AS
				- Have only one connection to another AS.
				- Can't be used for transit traffic as there is no one on the other side
			- Multihomed AS
				- Has more than one connection to other ASs.
				- Still has only one source or sink for data traffic.
			- Transit AS
				- It is a multihomed AS that also allows transient traffic.
		- BGP is a form of distance vector protocol, but it is quite unlike intradomain distance vector protocols such as RIP
			- Policy instead of minimum distance is used to pick routes.
			- Instead of maintaining the cost of each path, it keeps track of the path used.
		- Pair of BGP routers communicate with each other by establishing TCP connections.
		- Instead of periodic updates, router tells its neighbours the exact path it is using.
		- Check ma'am pdf notes to know how each node sends information to its neighbours
		- Eliminates count to infinity problem
# IPv6
	- It was introduced because of the shortage of IPv4 addresses
	- It uses 128-bit addresses.
	- Major features
		- Longer address than IPv4.
		- Simplified header
		- Better support for options
		- Improved security
		- Authentication and privacy are key features
		- More attention was paid to quality of service
		- End to end connectivity
		- Mobility
		- Faster forwarding/ routing
		- Extensibility
		- Auto configuration
		- Smooth transition
	- Comparison between IPv4 and IPv6 in ma'am's notes
	- IPv6 datagram diagram in ma'am's pdf
	- IPv6 address is 4 times larger than IPv4
		- the header of IPv6 is 2 times larger than the IPv4
	- IPv6 headers have on Fixed header and zero or more optional(Extension) headers.
		- All the necessary information that is essential for a router is kept in the fixed header
		- The Extension headers contain optional information that helps routers understand how to handle a packet/flow.
