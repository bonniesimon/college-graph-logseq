# Empirical Estimation Models
	- Size Estimation
		- Estimation of size is a critical and difficult part of project planning.
		- Difficulties lie in the fact that software is essentially an abstract.
		- **Lines of Code (LOC)**
			- A LOC is any line of program that is not a comment or blank line, regardless of the number of statements or fragments of statements on the line.
		- **Function Count**
			- It measures functionality from the users point of view.
			- It deals with the functionality being delivered and not the lines of code.
			- It is independent on the technology used to deliver functions.
	- Coast Estimation
		- Approximate judgement of the costs for a project. It should be done throughout the entire life cycle.
		- Why we need cost estimation?
			- To determine how much effort and time the software project needs.
			- Important for making good management decisions
			- It facilitates competitive bids.
			- It affects the planning and budgeting of the project.
	- Three main approaches to estimation
		- Empirical Techniques
			- An educated guess based on past experience
		- Heuristic Techniques
			- The characteristics to be estimated are expressed in terms of a mathematical expression.
		- Analytical Techniques
			- derive the required results starting from simple assumptions
	- Cost Estimation Models
		- Estimation is the process of finding an estimate or approximation, which is a value that can be used for some purpose even if the input data is incomplete, uncertain or unstable.
		- Estimation determines how much money, effort, resources and time it will take to build a specific system or product.
		- Estimation Models use derived formulas to predict effort as a function of LOC.
		- In these models, the software project is represented in terms of effort required to develop it successfully.
		- Cost Estimation Models classified into two models
			- Algorithmic Models
				- Estimations in these models are based on mathematical equations which are based on historic data or thoery
				- Types are :
					- COCOMO
					- COCOMO II
					- Software Equation
			- Non Algorithmic Models
				- Estimation on these models depends on the prior experience and domain knowledge of project managers.
				- They do not use mathematical equations rather use expert judgement or estimation by analogy, etc.
	- Empirical Estimation Model
		- The structure of empirical estimation models is a formula,
			- derived from data collected from past projects
			- that uses software size to estimate effort. Effort itself is an estimate described either as LOC or FC.
		- No estimation model is appropriate for all development environments, development processes or application types.
		  Models must be customized based on data from the particular environment.
			- E = a + b (S) c
			- E : Effort (in person months). Amount of labor that will be required to complete the task, measured in person-months units.
			- S : size in LOC or FC.
			- a, b, c : values derived from the project environment
	- Static, Single variable models
		- This model use an equation to estimate the desired values such as cost, time, effort, etc.
		- C = a L ^b
			- C : cost
			- L : size in lines of code in thousand lines
			- a, b : constants
		- E = 1.4 L ^ 0.93
			- E : effort in person-months
		- DOC = 30.4 L ^ 0.90
		- D = 4.6 L 0.26
	- COCOMO Model
		- It is a single variable software cost estimation model developed by Barry Boehm.
		- It uses basic regression formula with parameters that are derived from historical project data and current project characteristics.
		- Divides software product development into 3 categories:
			- Organic : Relatively small groups, working to develop well understood applications
			- Semidetached : Project team consists of a mixture of experienced and inexperienced staff.
			- Embedded : The software is strongly coupled with complex hardware and real time systems.
		- COCOMO is applied to
			- Organic Mode
			- Semidetached Mode
			- Embedded Mode
		- For the 3 categories, for size estimation (in KLOC), Boehm provides equations to predict
			- project duration in months
			- effort in programmer-months
		- KLOC : size measured in term of thousand delivered lines of code
		- Software cost estimation done through three stages:
			- Basic COCOMO
			- Intermediate COCOMO
			- Complete COCOMO
