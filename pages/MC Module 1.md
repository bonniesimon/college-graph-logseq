- *Internet - the ubiquitous network*
	- Ubiquitous means everywhere
	- Only two ubiquitous networks are : telecommunication network and internet network.
		- Telecommunication uses SS#7 protocol
		- Internet uses TCP/IP protocol
	- Packet switched networks like internet can tolerate some delays while real time communication is better provided by telecommunication networks.
	- Network can be divided into three main segments :
		- Core
			- It is the backbone of the network
			- Innermost part of the network
			- Core looks at traffic from a bit stream point of view
			- Primary function : deliver traffic efficiently at the least cost.
			- Deals with transmission media and transfer points
		- Edge
			- Deals with the distribution of the traffic.
			- Edge looks at traffic from a service point of view.
			- Managed and owned by ISP's.
		- Access
			- Deals with the devices and how they will access the trafic.
			- Can be either wired or wireless. From a MC standpoint, it is wireless.
	- Internet is the preferred bearer network for content that can tolerate some delays. (Here bearer implies the thing that will carry the content, i.e internet)
	- Internet supports many protocols.
	- For ubiquitous access, web applications are preferred.
	- Web applications use HTTP and have a request/response model.
	- Difference between web application and convectional client/server paradigm
		- In convectional client server paradigm the client handles some business logic.
		- While in web application the clients only handle the rendering functions. This is handled by the web browsers. Thin clients that don't handle business logic.
- *Architecture for mobile computing *
	- Mobile computing uses a three tier architecture
		- ![image.png](C:/Other Stuff/logseq/college/assets/image_1621765464921_0.png){:height 381, :width 534}
		- The three tiers are :
			- Presentation or User Interface Tier
				- Deals with device handling and rendering
				- Include user system interface where user services reside. (user services are sessions, text input, dialog and display management)
			- Process Management or Application Tier
				- For application programs or process management
				- business logic and rules are executed here.
				- controls transactions and asynchronous queuing to ensure reliable connection.
				- Capable of accommodating hundreds of users.
			- Database Management or Data Tier
				- Used for database access and management
		- Three tier architecture
		  id:: 60aa2f25-1ecf-4bba-abcd-69e75bc29f5f
			- is better suited for an effective client-server design
			- It provides increased _performance_, _flexibility_, _maintainability_, _reusability_ and _scalability_ .
			- hides complexity of distributed processing from the user
		- The above reasons have made the three tier architecture the choice for internet applications and net centric information systems.
- *Three Tier Architecture*
	- Designing a system for mobile computing means that the system will be used through any network, bearer, agent and device
	- Why it is necessary for mobile computing to have three tier architecture ?
		- ((60aa2f25-1ecf-4bba-abcd-69e75bc29f5f))
	- Why is it necessary for mobile computing to use internet?
	  collapsed:: true
		- A system for mobile computing should be able to be accessed through any network, bearer, device and agent.
		- To have universal access, it is desirable for the server to be connected to a ubiquitous network like the internet.
	- *Presentation (Tier 1)*
		- It is a user facing system of the tiers.
		- Presentation layer is responsible for presenting information to the user
		- It is responsible for rendering the information into a screen.
		- Consists of agent applications and systems that run on client devices and offer all the user interfaces.
		- The agent software in the client device can be a browser and in some cases an applet running on a browser or a virtual machine.
		- Functions performed by agent software range from simple tasks like accessing other application through HTTP API, to sophisticated task like real time scales or inventory management.
		- Some agents work as web scrapers.
	- *Application(Tier 2)*
		- Application layer is the engine of a ubiquitous application
		- It performs business logic of processing user input, obtaining data and making decisions
		- In some cases, this layer will do transcoding of data for appropriate rendering in the presentation layer
		- This tier include technologies like CGI's, JAVA, JSP, .NET, PHP, etc.
		- The application layer is presentation and database independent.
		- In addition to business logic, the application layer performs some other functions like
			- decisions on rendering, network management, security, datastore access, etc.
		- Most of these functions are implemented using middleware software
		- *Middleware framework* is defined as a layer of software in-between the operating system and the user facing software.
		- Middlewares include a wide range of software systems like
			- distributed objects and components
			- message oriented communication
			- database connectors
			- transaction drivers
		- Middleware can be considered as a software gateway connecting two independent open objects.
		- Categories of middleware are
			- *Message oriented middlewares(MOM)*
				- Middleware framework that connects different applications through asynchronous exchange of messages
				- it works over a networked environment without knowing the platform or processor the other application is resident on. It simple passes the messages.
				- MOM is generally synchronous, peer-to-peer and works in a publish/subscribe  fashion.
				- However MOM also supports request/response message passing too.
				- MOM is appropriate for event driven applications
			- *Transaction Processing (TP) Middlewares*
				- TP middleware provides tools and an environment for developing transaction based distributed applications.
				- An idea TP system would
					- input data into the system at the point of information source
					- output of system at the point of information sink.
				- Functions of TP
					- maps numerous clients requests through application service routines to different application tasks
					- numerous management features like restarting failed processes
					- dynamic load balancing
					- ensuring consistency of distributed data
				- TP optimizes the use of resources by multiplexing many client functions to much smaller set of application service routines. This helps in reducing the response time.
				- TP is used in
					- data management
					- network access
					- security systems
					- delivery order processing
					- airline reservations
					- customer service
				- TP is capable of providing services to thousands of clients in a distributed client/server environment.
				- Java uses MVC which is an example of a TP system.
			- *Communication Middleware*
				- Communication Middleware is used to connect one application to another.
				- eg : connecting one application to another using telnet
				- they are quite useful in the telecommunication world.
			- *Distributed Object and Components*
				- CORBA is an example
			- *Transcoding Middleware*
				- Transcoding middleware is used to transcode one format of data to another to meet the need of the client
				- html converted to wml to access website in mobile phone supporting WAP.
				- Transcoding is used for content adaption to fit the need of the device.
				- Content adaption is required to meet the network bandwidth needs.
				- content adaption done through Internet Content Adaption Protocol(ICAP)
				- *Internet Content Adaption Protocol(ICAP)*
					- It is a protocol aimed at providing simple object based content vectoring for HTTP services
					- So in simple terms it takes the content and converts it into a form that can be displayed on the client device.
					- Content might be intended for desktop users. So it needs to be converted so that it can be used by mobile users.
				- *Web Services*
	- *Data(Tier 3)*
		- Data tier is used to store data needed by the application and acts as a repository for both temporary and permanent data.
		- Data can be stored in any from of datastore or database.
		- relational databases, legacy hierarchical databases, to even simple text files.
		- *Database middleware*
			- we discussed how business logic should be separate from presentation. Similarly business logic should be independent of database
			- database independence helps in the maintenance of the system better.
			- Database middleware runs between the application program and the database. These are sometimes called database connectors.
		- SyncML
			- SyncML protocol is an emerging standard for synchronization of data access from different nodes.
- *Design Considerations for Mobile Computing*
	- Context means all the information that helps determine the state of an object.
	- Mobile computing environment should be context independent and context sensitive
	- Since the users and devices of a mobile communication are constantly changing,
	- we need to adapt the content or behaviour to better suit this context.
	- Context data helps use the apply the above.
	- There are many ways by which content and behaviour can be adapted
		- Content with context awareness
		- Content switch on context
		- Content transcoding on context
