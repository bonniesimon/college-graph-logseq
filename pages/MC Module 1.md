- *Internet - the ubiquitous network*
  - Ubiquitous means everywhere
  - Only two ubiquitous networks are : telecommunication network and internet network.
    - Telecommunication uses SS#7 protocol
    - Internet uses TCP/IP protocol
  - Packet switched networks like internet can tolerate some delays while real time communication is better provided by telecommunication networks.
  - Network can be divided into three main segments :
    - Core
      - It is the backbone of the network
      - Innermost part of the network
      - Core looks at traffic from a bit stream point of view
      - Primary function : deliver traffic efficiently at the least cost.
      - Deals with transmission media and transfer points
    - Edge
      - Deals with the distribution of the traffic.
      - Edge looks at traffic from a service point of view.
      - Managed and owned by ISP's.
    - Access
      - Deals with the devices and how they will access the trafic.
      - Can be either wired or wireless. From a MC standpoint, it is wireless.
  - Internet is the preferred bearer network for content that can tolerate some delays. (Here bearer implies the thing that will carry the content, i.e internet)
  - Internet supports many protocols.
  - For ubiquitous access, web applications are preferred.
  - Web applications use HTTP and have a request/response model.
  - Difference between web application and convectional client/server paradigm
    - In convectional client server paradigm the client handles some business logic.
    - While in web application the clients only handle the rendering functions. This is handled by the web browsers. Thin clients that don't handle business logic.
- *Architecture for mobile computing *
  - Mobile computing uses a three tier architecture
    - ![image.png](C:/Other Stuff/logseq/college/assets/image_1621765464921_0.png)
    - The three tiers are :
      - Presentation or User Interface Tier
        - Deals with device handling and rendering
        - Include user system interface where user services reside. (user services are sessions, text input, dialog and display management)
      - Process Management or Application Tier
        - For application programs or process management
        - business logic and rules are executed here.
        - controls transactions and asynchronous queuing to ensure reliable connection.
        - Capable of accommodating hundreds of users.
      - Database Management or Data Tier
        - Used for database access and management
    - Three tier architecture
      id:: 60aa2f25-1ecf-4bba-abcd-69e75bc29f5f
      - is better suited for an effective client-server design
      - It provides increased _performance_, _flexibility_, _maintainability_, _reusability_ and _scalability_ .
      - hides complexity of distributed processing from the user
    - The above reasons have made the three tier architecture the choice for internet applications and net centric information systems.
- *Three Tier Architecture*
  - Designing a system for mobile computing means that the system will be used through any network, bearer, agent and device
  - Why it is necessary for mobile computing to have three tier architecture ?
    - ((60aa2f25-1ecf-4bba-abcd-69e75bc29f5f))
  - Why is it necessary for mobile computing to use internet?
    collapsed:: true
    - A system for mobile computing should be able to be accessed through any network, bearer, device and agent.
    - To have universal access, it is desirable for the server to be connected to a ubiquitous network like the internet.
  - *Presentation (Tier 1)*
    - It is a user facing system of the tiers.
    - Presentation layer is responsible for presenting information to the user
    - It is responsible for rendering the information into a screen.
    - Consists of agent applications and systems that run on client devices and offer all the user interfaces.
    - The agent software in the client device can be a browser and in some cases an applet running on a browser or a virtual machine.
    - Functions performed by agent software range from simple tasks like accessing other application through HTTP API, to sophisticated task like real time scales or inventory management.
    - Some agents work as web scrapers.
  - *Application(Tier 2)*
    - Application layer is the engine of a ubiquitous application
    - It performs business logic of processing user input, obtaining data and making decisions
    - In some cases, this layer will do transcoding of data for appropriate rendering in the presentation layer
    - This tier include technologies like CGI's, JAVA, JSP, .NET, PHP, etc.
    - The application layer is presentation and database independent.
    - In addition to business logic, the application layer performs some other functions like
      - decisions on rendering, network management, security, datastore access, etc.
    - Most of these functions are implemented using middleware software
    - *Middleware framework* is defined as a layer of software in-between the operating system and the user facing software.
    - Middlewares include a wide range of software systems like
      - distributed objects and components
      - message oriented communication
      - database connectors
      - transaction drivers
    - Middleware can be considered as a software gateway connecting two independent open objects.
    - Categories of middleware are
      - *Message oriented middlewares(MOM)*
        - Middleware framework that connects different applications through asynchronous exchange of messages
        - it works over a networked environment without knowing the platform or processor the other application is resident on. It simple passes the messages.
        - MOM is generally synchronous, peer-to-peer and works in a publish/subscribe  fashion.
        - However MOM also supports request/response message passing too.
        - MOM is appropriate for event driven applications
      - *Transaction Processing (TP) Middlewares*
        - TP middleware provides tools and an environment for developing transaction based distributed applications.
        - An idea TP system would
          - input data into the system at the point of information source
          - output of system at the point of information sink.
        - Functions of TP
          - maps numerous clients requests through application service routines to different application tasks
          - numerous management features like restarting failed processes
          - dynamic load balancing
          - ensuring consistency of distributed data
        - TP optimizes the use of resources by multiplexing many client functions to much smaller set of application service routines. This helps in reducing the response time.
        - TP is used in
          - data management
          - network access
          - security systems
          - delivery order processing
          - airline reservations
          - customer service
        - TP is capable of providing services to thousands of clients in a distributed client/server environment.
        - Java uses MVC which is an example of a TP system.
